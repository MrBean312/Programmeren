			There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage
			participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the
			style sheet into this very page. The HTML remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external
			CSS file. Yes, really.

			CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this can be
			illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are
			placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have
			contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.</div><br>

			Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so strong CSS skills are necessary too, but the example files are commented well enough that even CSS novices can use them as starting points. Please see the CSS Resource Guide for advanced tutorials and tips on working with CSS.
			You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the HTML. This may seem daunting at first if you’ve never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.
			Download the sample HTML and CSS to work on a copy locally. Once you have completed your masterpiece (and please, don’t submit half-finished work) upload your CSS file to a web server under your control. Send us a link to an archive of that file and all associated assets, and if we choose to use it we will download it and place it on our server.
